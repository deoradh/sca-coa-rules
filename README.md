Document generation for the SCA College of Arms rules documents

Maintaining SENA, the Adminstrative Handbook, and other rules documents of the College of Arms in various formats has become burdensome
and prone to human error keeping them synchronized.  Better, we figured, to make a master document which requires no special software
to edit and from which could be generated using common open-source software all the formats needed, specifically HTML, PDF and RTF.

This sounds like a job for XSLT and FOP.  And so it is.

I use xsltproc and fop to get the job done.  I've added my Makefile so that it's obvious how.  I stink at Makefiles.

Feel free to contact me with questions, etc.
